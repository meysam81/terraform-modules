## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of OpenTofu/Terraform modules
developed through years of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) experience.

These modules represent an opinionated, battle-tested approach to
infrastructure as code (IaC) across diverse platforms and environments.

### 🎯 Design Philosophy

- **Pragmatic Solutions**: Modules crafted from real-world SRE challenges
- **Best Practices Baked-In**: Incorporate industry standards and security
  considerations
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various infrastructure needs
- **Minimal Configuration**: Sensible defaults with easy customization
- **Sealed and Security Hardened**: Secure by default with minimal attack
  surface, gated behind Checkov and trivy security checks on every commit

## 📝 Notes

landscapes, these modules represent a distillation of practical, scalable
solutions to common infrastructure challenges.
